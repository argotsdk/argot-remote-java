Argot Remote
============

The Argot Remote extension is designed to provide the ability to describe remote
APIs in a similar way to older style RPC mechanisms.  The difference however,
is implementation can be through a number of mechanisms.  Both a simple rpc protocol
and more extensive agent based protocol has been developed in the Colony project
based on this.

Project also includes an implementation of the Argot type resolution protocol which
can be used where two way communication is present.  It builds agreed type maps
between peers.
